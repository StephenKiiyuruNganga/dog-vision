    I’m on a quest to master machine learning. I have journeyed through the lands of web development
    and mobile applications, but I felt a calling to explore the realm 
    of artificial intelligence. 

    You can witness my progress on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/skiiyuru)
    
    Want to see the code behind this awesome project? 😎 
    * [How I built this app](https://github.com/skiiyuru/dog-vision/blob/main/Home.py)
    * [How I trained the model](https://github.com/skiiyuru/dog-vision/blob/main/dog_vision.ipynb)

    I’m always looking for new allies and adventures, so don’t 
    hesitate to contact me if you share my passion for machine learning. 
    Or, if you have a different passion, maybe I can convince you to join 
    the dark side. 😁
